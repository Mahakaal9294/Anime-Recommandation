# Anime-Recommandation
I'm developing an anime recommendation system that identifies and suggests similar shows based on various characteristics. This system is built entirely from scratch, beginning with the creation of a comprehensive dataset through the use of APIs to gather detailed information about a wide range of animes. The data includes key attributes such as genres, themes, character profiles, plot summaries, and art styles. 

In building this anime recommendation system, I'm utilizing an API sourced from a GitHub repository, which can be found [here]([www.github.com/api_link](https://github.com/falcon71181/Anime-API?tab=readme-ov-file#aniwatch)). This API provides a rich dataset of anime-related information, including genres, themes, character details, and plot summaries. The API ensures that the dataset is comprehensive and up-to-date, which is essential for creating accurate and relevant recommendations. By integrating this API, the system can efficiently gather the necessary data without manual curation, allowing for a streamlined and scalable development process.

After collecting the raw data, the next step is data preprocessing, which involves cleaning and structuring the data for analysis. This includes handling missing values, normalizing text fields, encoding categorical data, and ensuring consistency across the dataset. These preprocessing steps are crucial for ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of the similarity model that will be built.

Once the data is cleaned and prepared, a similarity model is developed to analyze the relationships between different animes. This model may use various techniques, such as cosine similarity, content-based filtering, or collaborative filtering, to measure how closely related different shows are based on their features. The goal is to create a model that can accurately identify animes with similar characteristics, enabling personalized recommendations.

Finally, the recommendation system is deployed using Streamlit, a platform that allows for rapid development of interactive web applications. Streamlit makes it easy for users to interact with the system, input their favorite animes, and receive recommendations. The entire process—from data collection and preprocessing to model development and deployment—ensures that the system is robust, accurate, and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for users looking to discover new anime content tailored to their tastes.
